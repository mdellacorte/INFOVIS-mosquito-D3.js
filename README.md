# INFOVIS-mosquito-D3.js
A small mosquito that moves randomly in the drawing area (when it comes out from the right edge it comes back from the left and when it comes out from below it falls from above, etc.). When you click with the mouse on the mosquito it remains crushed and falls down, to reappear in another random point on the screen. It is developed with Javascript and D3.js
